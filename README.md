This is Agora Web!

## What is dAgora?

Agora is a content co-creation service within the community

We save community information using the Discord bot Cori and upload it to the Crossbell chain for members to use as writing material.

## Why dAgora

**Agora can create value for the community:**

Encouraging open communication and stimulating discussion by confirming the copyrights. 

The discord bot ’Cori’ allows community members to contribute material to each other, fostering trust and encouraging expression among members.

Through discussion, understanding and consensus building, it helps community members build a strong foundation for collaboration.

The recorded messages can be seen as the soul of the community. Through Agora, the community is able to attract people who have the same vibe.

**Agora can help individuals build influence:**

Community members can use agora as a tool for individuals to quickly record their ideas.

Members can record their messages in different servers through Cori, and gather their content under one identity.
